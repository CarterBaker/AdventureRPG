# CharacterEditorPipeline

Where the character tools live, which method owns each operation, and the traps. Read it before working in the
Character Editor, the Animation Editor, their docker windows, or a character's appearance (morphs, zones, masks,
shaders). `.claude/CLAUDE.md` still applies in full.

## Windows

Every character tool is split into windows, the way Krita splits its dockers. A viewport tab holds the toolbar, the
status bar and the viewport; everything else is its own tab, opened from the editor's Content menu and restored by
layouts like any other.

| Window | Context | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| Character Editor | `CharacterEditorContext` | the preview, its overlay and the mode toolbar; a tool canvas in Mesh, Sculpt, Weights and Rig |
| Character Outliner | `CharacterOutlinerContext` | `CharacterEditorManager.buildListRows` |
| Character Properties | `CharacterPropertiesContext` | `CharacterEditorManager.buildPropertyRows` |
| Animation Editor | `AnimationEditorContext` | the posed character; the Animation Pose tool canvas while a clip plays on a character |
| Animation Outliner | `AnimationOutlinerContext` | `AnimationEditorManager.buildListRows` |
| Animation Properties | `AnimationPropertiesContext` | `AnimationEditorManager.buildPropertyRows` |
| Animation Timeline | `AnimationTimelineContext` | transport, summary track and a dope sheet lane per bone |

- A docker context implements `CharacterViewRowSource` and creates `CharacterViewPanelSystem`,
  `CharacterViewDockSystem` and `ToolCanvasSystem`; the dock system opens `menus/editor/CharacterDock.arpg` and
  refills it only when the source's revision moves. Row templates stay in the tool's own menu
  (`EditorSetting.CHARACTER_EDITOR_ROW_TEMPLATES`, `ANIMATION_EDITOR_ROW_TEMPLATES`) so their buttons route to the
  tool's branch. A tool without a text row template must never list a `TEXT` row.
- Tools are the Tools window's (`ToolCanvas.CHARACTER_MESH`, `CHARACTER_SCULPT`, `CHARACTER_WEIGHTS`,
  `CHARACTER_RIG`, `ANIMATION_POSE`); brushes the Brushes window's. Add a tool to a canvas in `ToolCanvas`, never as a
  panel button.

## Modes

`CharacterEditorMode` carries its behaviour as data: its tool canvas, whether it edits a worn mesh, whether it holds
the bind pose, whether it draws vertices, and its status hint. Check those flags, never `mode == X`, except where a
mode's own branch is chosen (`SCULPT` strokes the shape, `RIG` undoes the rig).

## Characters

A character is one rigged body mesh with its whole head modelled in (`mesh/characters/humanoid/HumanoidBodyMesh`) plus
worn feature meshes (`FeatureSlot`: hair). Nothing is a texture swap.

- **Mesh format** (`RiggedMeshArpgUtility`): every quad may name its `zone` (`MeshZone`: skin, eye, brow, lash, hair,
  cloth, mouth, teeth); `masks` (channels `EngineSetting.RIGGED_MESH_MASK_CHANNELS`) and `morphs` name vertices by the
  number the parse gives them, corners merged by position and influences in the order they first appear. Writing
  renumbers through `resolveFileVertices`, so never index masks or morphs by `RiggedMeshStruct` order in a file.
- **GPU path.** `RiggedMeshGeometryUtility` writes per corner its morph entry run, zone with raw UV and masks (the
  trailing attributes `EngineSetting.RIGGED_MESH_TRAILING_ATTRIBUTE_SIZES`); the morph deltas live in the mesh's morph
  texture (`MeshHandle.getMorphTexture`). Each instance's palette row (`SkinnedBufferData`) holds its bones, then the
  appearance texels (`SkinnedAppearanceStruct`: hidden bone, one texel per `SkinnedColor`, `SkinnedDetail` amounts),
  then its morph weights. The shaders read them through `characters/includes/CharacterAppearance.glsl` and shade by
  zone in `CharacterSurface.glsl`; keep the GLSL constants in step with the enums.
- **Appearance.** `AppearanceData` holds the template's colors, palettes, details, shape sliders (`shapes`, each a
  morph with a group and range) and the morphs each `AppearanceExpression` plays. `AppearanceHandle` keeps slider
  values as morph weights, plays the blink (`updateFace`, through the half shape) and hands everything to a draw in
  `writeAppearance`. The creator lists shapes by group (the body group on the Body tab); saves store shapes by morph
  name.
- **Shape keys in the editor.** Sculpt mode's Shape Keys rows pick the morph being sculpted
  (`CharacterMeshBranch.editShape`): the morph is lifted into the positions so every tool works unchanged, and baked
  back into deltas when sculpting returns to the base, the mode or part changes, or the mesh is saved. Mesh modes
  preview with every slider at zero and the face still.
- **Assets.** The base body, its 48 morphs and the hair styles are generated (catalogued); a rigged mesh may hold at
  most `RIGGED_MESH_VERT_LIMIT` corners.

## Who owns what

- Sculpt strokes: `CharacterShapeBranch` (begin, stamp, end). The viewport fills one `CharacterStampStruct` per stamp
  in `CharacterEditorSculptSystem.placeStamp`.
- Rig: `CharacterRigBranch` owns the draft read from the rig's InfoManager entry, every rig edit (`edit`), its
  history and the live apply (`RigManager.updateRig`). Values and actions: `CharacterRigPropertyBranch`; rows:
  `CharacterRigRowBranch`; viewport: `CharacterEditorRigSystem`.
- Clip edits: `AnimationEditBranch.edit` records every edit in the clip's `CharacterViewHistoryStruct`; pose drags
  go through `AnimationEditorManager.beginPose / writePose / endPose / cancelPose`; viewport:
  `AnimationEditorPoseSystem`.
- Rotation and projection math shared by every viewport gesture: `CharacterPoseUtility`.

## Traps

- **Bones are structure.** Clips, masks, skinned buffers, appearances and live poses are all laid out by a rig's bones
  at load. `RigManager.updateRig` applies a rig in place only while its bone names, order and parents are unchanged
  (joint placement, bind rotation, size); adding, renaming, reparenting or mirroring bones is written to the rig and
  takes hold on the next start. Only bones added since the start (`CharacterRigBranch.canRename`) may be renamed or
  removed, because nothing loaded names them yet.
- **`throwException` halts the process** unless an isolation boundary is open. Editor actions, shortcuts and tab
  updates run inside one, which is why `CharacterRigBranch.apply` and `CharacterPreviewBranch.rebuild` can catch
  `InternalException`. Never call a builder that can refuse from outside an isolated path.
- **Re-read entries, never cache them.** A revert replaces an InfoManager document's root, so a held `ArpgObjectStruct`
  goes stale. Fetch the entry through `InfoManager.findEntry` each time.
- **Shape keys clear the history.** Entering or leaving a shape key clears the mesh's undo steps, since they hold the
  surface as it was being sculpted.
- **A mesh's morph count can change under a skinned buffer.** An added shape key widens the palette row;
  `SkinnedBufferInstance.clear` lays the row out again. Never size anything per instance from a morph count read once.
- **Sculpt works on an unrounded copy.** Positions are written rounded to the editor's precision; a stroke keeps its
  own float copy so small stamps accumulate. Topology and mirror pairs are fixed for the stroke's length.
- **Euler angles.** Bones compose `Rz * Ry * Rx` from degrees and a clip's rotation is added to the bind rotation.
  Read a turn back with `CharacterPoseUtility.toEuler` against the angle it replaces, so keys never spin the long way.
