     * BranchPackage is a specialized ManagerPackage.

     * specific responsibility or execution path.

     * A branch processes defined input, performs targeted functions,
     * and is designed to operate in conjunction with other branches.
     * By extending ManagerPackage, a branch may register its own systems,
     * effectively splitting manager functionality into modular units.
